# CS3-Project
Hi, this is my final project for Computer Science III. You can download the files together as a zip and then compile them together as a Java project. On Eclipse, the files would be dropped into the src folder, so it should be a similar folder in JCreator. The file that will be run is the one named "Project.java". I hope you enjoy my project.
