# CS3-Project
Hi, this is my final project for Computer Science III. You can download the files together as a zip and then compile them together as a Java project. On Eclipse, the files would be dropped into the src folder, so it should be a similar folder in JCreator. The file that will be run is the one named "Project.java".  
  
I had to go back and edit a few things that used symbols within a string and wouldn't show when the files were downloaded.  
  
Maps - j.getInputMap(JComponent.WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW) and j.getActionMap() in "Game.java" and "Stage.java", where j is a JLabel  
  
LinkedList - Enemy[] left, right in "Stage.java", each element of these arrays is a linked list, where left contains the left-most node and right contains the right-most node  
  
Binary Search Tree - ScoreNode bst in "Game.java" and "Stage.java", used to hold the scores  

Please let me know if there is anything that won't compile when it downloads. I hope you enjoy my project!
